## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

m <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
m

m <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = FALSE)
m
matrix usually filled by columns(hence byrow = false)

m <- matrix(data = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
str(l)
names(l) <- c("string", "matrix", "logical")
names(l)
l$string 
l$matrix[3, 5] 
m
an example of a by row matrix instead of by column 

v1 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
v2 <- c(6, 7, 8, 9)
m1 <- rbind(v1, v2)
m1
matrix by row

m2 <- cbind(v1, v2)
m2
matrix by column

class(m1)
dim(m1)
number of rows and columns
class(m2)
dim(m2)
colnames(m2)
rownames(m2)
str(m2)

a <- array(data = 1:90, dim = c(5, 6, 3))
a

v <- 1:100  #This creates a vector containing all integers from 1 to 100
v
v[1:15]
v[c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)]
v <- 101:200
v[seq(from = 1, to = 100, by = 2)]

s <- c("this", "is", "a", "vector", "of", "strings")  # here we have a vector
m <- matrix(data = 1:40, nrow = 5, ncol = 8)  # this is a matrix
b <- FALSE  #and this is a logical statement
l <- list(s, m, b)  # this puts them all together as a list
l
l[[2]][2, 6]
l[1:2]
l[c(1, 3)]

df <- data.frame(firstName = c("Nitin", "Silvy", "Ingrid", "Claire"), major = c("Biology (CM)",
    "Anthropology (Bio)", "Anthropology (Medical)", "Biology (EEB)"), sex = c("M",
    "F", "F", "F"), yearInProgram = c(1, 2, 2, 3))
df

df <- read.csv("~/Desktop/random-people.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
# only print select columns
df[, c(1, 3, 4, 11, 12)]
